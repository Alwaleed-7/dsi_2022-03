```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

Access "chunks" in an external script, which are marked by 

```
## ---- chunk-label
```

where `chunk-label` is the uniquw chunk label, by using `read_chunk('test.R')`.

```{r, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk('test.R')
```

Now we can use the code:

```{r, test-a, echo=FALSE}
```

```{r, test-b, fig.height=4}
```
